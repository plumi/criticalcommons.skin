</b></p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    (f) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
    </div>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
    Critical Commons’ designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is:</p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    Steve Anderson<br>
USC School of Cinematic Arts<br>
3470 McClintock Ave. SCI 101<br>
Los Angeles, CA, 90089-2211<br>

sfanders@usc.edu </p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent. Any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to the Critical Commons site manager through http://www.criticalcommons.org/contact-info. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of the DMCA, your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
    </div>


    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b>8. Counter-Notice
</b></p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    If you believe the User Submitted Content that was removed or disabled was not infringing, you have consent to use, or your use of the Content is permissible under the fair use doctrine, you may file a counter-notification with Critical Commons by providing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        (a) Your physical or electronic signature;</p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    (b) Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    (c) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; or</p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    (d) A statement that you believe your use of the content within the context of the Critical Commons website constitutes a use that is protected as fair under Section 107 of the Copyright Act; and</p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    (e) Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Los Angeles, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    As per the DMCA, if a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Critical Commons may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing them that Critical Commons will restore the removed content in 10 business days.Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against Critical Commons or the user which filed the counter-notice, Critical Commons will have the discretion to restore the user submitted content in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter. </p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    In keeping with the terms of the DMCA, removal of content that is allegedly infringing from the site is open to contestation. Generally speaking, we believe that the context established by Critical Commons to promote the use of media for education constitutes a strong basis for protection under fair use and we welcome discussions of these issues with site users and copyright holders alike.</p>
