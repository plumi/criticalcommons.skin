    <p style="text-align: left;">
    <i>Please note that these terms of service were written by lawyers for
    lawyers. However, we at Critical Commons strongly encourage you, as
    educated members of the public, to read and understand these terms of
    service and to decide whether you are actually comfortable with
    agreeing to them. </i></p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b>1. Your Acceptance</b></p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    By using and/or visiting this website (referred to collectively,
    including all content and functionality available through the
    CriticalCommons.org domain name, as the "Critical Commons Website", or
    "Website"), you (otherwise defined as “user” or “users”) signify your
    agreement to (1) these terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service"), <b>If you do not agree to any of these terms, please do not use the Critical Commons Website.</b></p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    Critical Commons may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these
    Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by
    such modifications or revisions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
    deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="left">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    <i>If you're not a lawyer and you're still reading, that's a good sign.
    We can tell you that, at this point, we have no intention of revising
    the Terms of Service, and it is only a matter of practicality that we
    cannot promise to notify you personally if anything changes. In this
    case, however, we will certainly make any necessary changes known in
    the blog section of the site, which is devoted to discussing ongoing
    issues in fair use among communities of users. </i></p>

    relieve Critical Commons from any and all liability arising from your
    use of any third-party website.</p>
